When we returned to California from Ireland in 2014, I was looking for another way to help our church reach out to our local community. I'd heard about the CoderDojo groups started in Ireland and it seemed like a great fit for our community. In October 2014, [Fremont CoderDojo](http://fremontcoderdojo.com) was born. Since then kids and teens have been coming with their parents, learning to code together - and it's been a blast. The kids' creativity is through the roof!
