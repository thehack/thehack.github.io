After months of planning, and literally thousands of volunteer hours given by local and international volunteers, we have the priveldge of looking back on the memory of another great Kid's Week. About 300 children attended one of three sites across our city for this 5-day event.

A drama based on the biblical character David's ascendancy to the throne provided the thematic backdrop for the events of the week. Children also engaged in singing, dance, indoor and outdoor games. A group of the children who practiced a dance throughout the week got to come back to perfrorm on the stage the Millennium Forum on Sunday in front of Cornerstone. Each of the children were invited back in for Sunday. We were delighted to have about 200 additional local guests with us following Kids' Week!
