Speed Bible is my work-in-progress experiment for speed-reading the Bible. Recent research has led to the development of new speed-reading tools like [Spritz](http://spritzinc.com/), which make it easier to speed-read by eliminating the need for eye movement. When I came across an open-source speed-reading tool online, I decided to pair it with the Bible API to try out with speed-reading the Bible.

There is much to be said for slow, methodical Bible study, but I found out this is a useful tool. When I use it, I feel like I'm devouring scripture. Because I can read much faster, I pick up on themes and story arc that I would have missed otherwise. 

Check it out and let me know what you think. [Speed Bible](https://speed-bible.appspot.com)
