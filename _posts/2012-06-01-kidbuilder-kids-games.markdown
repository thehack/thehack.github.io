In 2008 I began developing [KidBuilder.net](http://kidbuilder.net), a website which helps kids engage with scripture in a fun an intresting way. On the site, kids can kids can buy badges with coins earned by watching videos, completing quizzes, and solving puzzles.

The site has about 1,000 registered users, and gets about 20 visits a day. It probably appeals most to children between 6 and 11 years old. A complete rebuild with new games, graphics and features is underway.

#### Here are some of the fun comments we have received from children and their parents  12over the years:
